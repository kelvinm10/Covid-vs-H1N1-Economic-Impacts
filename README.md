# Covid & H1N1 Effects on Unemployment

Here, I implemented a Support vector Regression and K nearest Neighbor model in order to predict the unemployment rate had the two pandemics not occurred. The idea behind this is that we first built a Support vector regression to predict unemployment rate in general, then found that in order to visualize and determine the true impact of the pandemics, we needed to implement KNN, which would simply find the K nearest neighbors (we used 3 nearest neighbors) to the years 2020 and 2009, and thus predict an unemployment rate had the pandemics not occurred based on the mean unemployment rate of these 3 neighbors.
